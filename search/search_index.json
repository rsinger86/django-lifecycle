Specific lifecycle moments \u00b6 For simple cases, you might always want something to happen at a certain point, such as after saving or before deleting a model instance. When a user is first created, you could process a thumbnail image in the background and send the user an email: @hook ( AFTER_CREATE ) def do_after_create_jobs ( self ): enqueue_job ( process_thumbnail , self . picture_url ) mail . send_mail ( 'Welcome!' , 'Thank you for joining.' , 'from@example.com' , [ 'to@example.com' ], ) Or you want to email a user when their account is deleted. You could add the decorated method below: @hook ( AFTER_DELETE ) def email_deleted_user ( self ): mail . send_mail ( 'We have deleted your account' , 'We will miss you!.' , 'customerservice@corporate.com' , [ 'human@gmail.com' ], ) Read on to see how to only fire the hooked method if certain conditions about the model's current and previous state are met. Transitions between specific values \u00b6 Maybe you only want the hooked method to run under certain circumstances related to the state of your model. If a model's status field change from \"active\" to \"banned\" , you may want to send an email to the user: @hook ( AFTER_UPDATE , when = 'status' , was = 'active' , is_now = 'banned' ) def email_banned_user ( self ): mail . send_mail ( 'You have been banned' , 'You may or may not deserve it.' , 'communitystandards@corporate.com' , [ 'mr.troll@hotmail.com' ], ) The was and is_now keyword arguments allow you to compare the model's state from when it was first instantiated to the current moment. You can also pass \"*\" to indicate any value - these are the defaults, meaning that by default the hooked method will fire. The when keyword specifies which field to check against. Preventing state transitions \u00b6 You can also enforce certain disallowed transitions. For example, maybe you don't want your staff to be able to delete an active trial because they should expire instead: @hook ( BEFORE_DELETE , when = 'has_trial' , is_now = True ) def ensure_trial_not_active ( self ): raise CannotDeleteActiveTrial ( 'Cannot delete trial user!' ) We've omitted the was keyword meaning that the initial state of the has_trial field can be any value (\"*\"). Any change to a field \u00b6 You can pass the keyword argument has_changed=True to run the hooked method if a field has changed. @hook ( BEFORE_UPDATE , when = 'address' , has_changed = True ) def timestamp_address_change ( self ): self . address_updated_at = timezone . now () When a field's value is NOT \u00b6 You can have a hooked method fire when a field's value IS NOT equal to a certain value. @hook ( BEFORE_SAVE , when = 'email' , is_not = None ) def lowercase_email ( self ): self . email = self . email . lower () When a field's value was NOT \u00b6 You can have a hooked method fire when a field's initial value was not equal to a specific value. @hook ( BEFORE_SAVE , when = 'status' , was_not = \"rejected\" , is_now = \"published\" ) def send_publish_alerts ( self ): send_mass_email () When a field's value changes to \u00b6 You can have a hooked method fire when a field's initial value was not equal to a specific value but now is. @hook ( BEFORE_SAVE , when = 'status' , changes_to = \"published\" ) def send_publish_alerts ( self ): send_mass_email () Generally, changes_to is a shorthand for the situation when was_not and is_now have the same value.
